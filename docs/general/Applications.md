# Applications

Applications are all the self-hosted services you have running on your servers. You can add them to ServerDash to keep track of their status and get quick access to them.

## Adding an Application

To add a new application to ServerDash, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Add Application" button in the top right corner of the server menu:

   - **Local URL**: The URL for accessing the application within your local network (optional)
